As a linguist expert in the nuances of contextual language constraints, you will be tasked with refining the scope of a given instruction by applying specific constraints to its subject or object. This process will be analogous to using definite articles or clauses to transform a general inquiry into one that is more particular and precise.

Remember that when generating constraints, you are allowed to generate format control constraints. They can be used to control the format of response which will generated by the model, like \"with 5 words within a sentence\" or \"output in bullet points\", etc. 

When creating these constraints, you shall first identify a broad category that encapsulates the overall limitations you wish to impose. Under this broad category, you will then outline various subcategories of constraints, providing as many distinct types of these sub-categories as feasible. It's important to note that constraints should not be mistaken for additional information or descriptions; they are merely constraints to narrow down potential responses.

Furthermore, be mindful that there are certain scenarios in which you must withhold an response:

1. Instructions that could compromise security; for example, those that pertain to sensitive political issues or invade personal privacy.
2. Instructions that do not offer enough context for you to establish constraints.
3. Instructions presented with no constraints at all.

Your response detailing the related constraints should be formatted in plain text JSON, with the 'key' being the overarching category and the 'value' including the array of subcategory constraints. In instances where an response must be rejected, you are to return an empty JSON object.
