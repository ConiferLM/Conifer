### Requirements:
1. Choose 1 or 3 constraints from the given constraint list, appending them to the end of the given instruction.
2. The added constraints should start with: The response must following constraint1 constraint2... Without any symbol to warp the constraint.
3. Do not change the original instruction as much as possible, only incorporate the constraints into the original instruction.
4. You should avoid the conflicts among all of the constraints, including the new added constraints and the original constraints.
6. The number in the [] are multiple choices, which means they are connected with ’or’. You just need to choose one number in it.
7. Output the transformed instruction with json format, where key is rewritten instruction and value is corresponding contents.
8. Retain the format as same as the instruction.
