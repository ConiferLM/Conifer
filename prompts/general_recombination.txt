You will be provided with a list of [CONSTRAINTS] to apply to an original [INSTRUCTION]. The [CONSTRAINTS] are categorized, and each category includes several subcategories. Your task is to select appropriate categories and their associated subcategories to modify the [INSTRUCTION], crafting a [REWRITE OF THE INSTRUCTION] that is more specific and tailored.

For this exercise, not all categories and subcategories need to be employed. You will be producing a series of five instructions, with each instruction corresponding to a progressive level of difficulty, ranging from 1 to 5. Each level should incorporate an additional one to two categories and two to three subcategories to enhance complexity. Once the constraints' specified upper limits are reached, you may maintain that level of difficulty for subsequent instructions. The first level requires the use of one to two categories and two to three subcategories.

Keep in mind that the [REWRITE OF THE INSTRUCTION] may alter the perspective of the inquirer while remaining within the parameters set by the [CONSTRAINTS]. Add to the [REWRITE OF THE INSTRUCTION] using only the chosen [SUBCATEGORY X] without directly referencing the [CATEGORY].

Given the [CONSTRAINTS] and the original [INSTRUCTION], please generate a rewritten instruction for each difficulty level (1 through 5). The output should be formatted in JSON, with each difficulty level as a key and its corresponding rewritten instruction as the value.
